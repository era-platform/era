- The application/state you get to when you load a URL.
- The application/state you can undo and redo within a single visited URL, restored when you refocus or navigate back.
- The state of scroll bars, cursors, and window positioning, so transient and noncommital that they don't even need undo support -- or do they?

An application definition is:

- A set of knowledge.
- A set of extensions.
  - A set of entrypoints that would bring the application checkpoint up to date.
  - A set of entrypoints that would help the user act on the application state.

An application state is:

- An undo-redo history of up-to-date application checkpoints, actions, timestamps, and associated sensor data.
  - Some actions may embed their own interpolable history segments.

An application checkpoint is:

- A set of knowledge.
- A set of extensions.



A set of extensions... is a set of {$willingToExtend extensionPublicKey hubPublicKey value} values, which together become an {$extensionSet} value. Anyone authorized for a hubPublicKey can get a function from an {$extensionSet} into their specific subset of {$willingToExtend ...} values. Rather than sharing this function directly, they can publish other functions that use it internally.
