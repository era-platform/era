"\\= era-staccato-self-compiler.stc\n\\= Copyright 2015, 2016, 2021 Ross Angle.\n\\= Released under the MIT License.\n\n\n\\= Although this may look like source code, and it may even become\n\\= full source code at some point, right now it mostly serves as a\n\\= collection of notes.\n\\=\n\\= One side of the notes explores a potential high-level design for\n\\= Staccato macro definitions and ad hoc namespace manipulation. This\n\\= is far more expressive than Staccato is likely to support for some\n\\= time, but it means that I can begin writing Staccato code freely,\n\\= safe in the knowledge that I won't be tied down to regretful name\n\\= choices or ever-growing lists of syntactic primitives.\n\\=\n\\= The other side of these notes begins the more immediate exercise of\n\\= porting the era-stacato.js desugarer to Staccato. This could\n\\= hypothetically be used to implement `(defn ...)` and\n\\= `(def-type ...)` as macros someday, but what it ensures is that the\n\\= design of the desugarer itself is something programmers can replace\n\\= when needed. Furthermore, the port should ultimately support a\n\\= slightly different syntax than before: In a raw Staccato AST,\n\\= constructors and their projections will no longer be designated by\n\\= unqualified strings, but by fully qualified names.\n\n\n\\= ===== Notes about dependencies ====================================\n\n\\= (def-type string val)\n\\= A reference to a string. The value inside is in a format user-level\n\\= code does not know how to deconstruct.\n\n\\= (defn string-compare a b ...)\n\\= Compares two strings.\n\n\\= macro (str \\;qq[example string])\n\\= Obtains a first-class string value with the given literal text.\n\n\\= (def-type name val)\n\\= A reference to a fully qualified name. The value inside is in a\n\\= format user-level code does not know how to deconstruct.\n\n\\= (defn make-tuple-tag tuple-name proj-names)\n\\= Takes a name for the constructor and a list of names for the\n\\= projections, and returns the name used to dynamically tag a tuple\n\\= of that combination of names. The projection name list must be made\n\\= out of `(cons car cdr)` and `(nil)` values, with elements that are\n\\= strings, and the list must not have duplicates. The order of the\n\\= list will be ignored.\n\n\\= (defn name-metacompare a b ...)\n\\= Compares two names. For inequal names, the result will be in a\n\\= format user-level code does not know how to deconstruct. For equal\n\\= names, the result will be (nil).\n\\=\n\\= Names are somewhat useful for access control, and they're opaque\n\\= external tokens to an extent, but they're not entirely opaque. They\n\\= can be compared for equality.\n\\=\n\\= Macros would be less expressive if they had to treat names as\n\\= uncomparable values, and what benefit would that bring? The macros\n\\= would still have a range of expression close to that anyway: A\n\\= macro could still dive into one of its syntax parameters and\n\\= extract names from there into its own bag of tricks, so names\n\\= wouldn't really be secrets between macros. A macro could still\n\\= reconstruct a syntax parameter while inserting two occurrences of\n\\= any name it likes, just to ensure that the two occurrences are\n\\= equal. A macro could still do a hackish equality assertion by\n\\= defining something by one name and looking up the definition by\n\\= another. A macro could still do a hackish *inequality* assertion by\n\\= installing two definitions under the (supposedly) two names.\n\\=\n\\= If macros couldn't check names for equality, one thing a macro\n\\= couldn't do... is to associate a variable binding site with a\n\\= variable usage site. For instance, it couldn't act as a Staccato\n\\= desugarer. It couldn't act as a compiler of some other DSL, unless\n\\= that DSL completely forewent the namespace system and just used\n\\= string names everywhere. So people who have adventurous new\n\\= syntaxes to try would want to build new namespace systems for them,\n\\= and this macro system would have complicated the Staccato language\n\\= for no purpose that couldn't have been accomplished with an\n\\= exhaustive suite of built-in syntaxes.\n\\=\n\\= (TODO: Do nominal types already support an equality check?\n\\= James Cheney's \"Simple Nominal Type Theory\" presents systems with\n\\= and without equality checks. If this is very common, maybe we can\n\\= rationalize this decision in terms of standard practice too.)\n\\=\n\\= So, macros will be able to compare names for equality. As long as\n\\= they can do that, we could promote better efficiency by permitting\n\\= ordered comparisons instead of just equality checks. That way,\n\\= names could be lookup keys in AVL trees and other efficiently\n\\= indexed data structures.\n\\=\n\\= It's tricky, because names have no natural ordering. Even if they\n\\= were arbitrarily associated with strings and ordered that way, that\n\\= ordering would not be stable in the face of capture-avoiding\n\\= alpha-renaming! So whatever order we use, it will expose\n\\= implementation details and make namespace sandboxing into a\n\\= headache... unless, that is, the implementation details were hidden\n\\= in a familiar way: By using obscure naming (and enforcing this\n\\= obscurity with code-signing if necessary).\n\\=\n\\= To wit, we can refrain from exposing implementation details by\n\\= defining \"metacompare\" operations that usually work like \"compare\"\n\\= operations, but sometimes return values that user-defined macro\n\\= code doesn't know how to deconstruct. (The \"meta\" stands for\n\\= \"metacircular\", under the idea that there may be a few layers of\n\\= the reflective tower all running as macros in the same\n\\= macroexpansion phase. Each layer must be implemented with obscure\n\\= names that its interpreted layer doesn't know about.) Once we have\n\\= metacomparison operations, we can provide encapsulated data types\n\\= that sort their data using a metacomparison.\n\\=\n\\= If we just support encapsulated AVL trees, that might go a long\n\\= way, especially if it serves as a complete model of computation\n\\= over unordered collections. We can get quite a range of\n\\= computational ability all at once if we simply add a metacomparator\n\\= over the AVL trees themselves. For instance, that lets us detect\n\\= emptiness by comparing to the empty tree, and it lets us detect\n\\= singletonhood by looping over the entries and comparing to the\n\\= singletons of each.\n\\=\n\\= In the process, a lot of ugliness may arise: If concatenation of\n\\= encapsulated AVL trees doesn't somehow check that their\n\\= metacomparators are equivalent, we may end up with malformed\n\\= encapsulated AVL trees that leak implementation details. We could\n\\= potentially avoid this situation by passing some sort of equality\n\\= certifier to the concatenation operation, but then we'd need a\n\\= specialized language (or at least a collection of combinators) for\n\\= defining equality certifiers. An easier approach would be to use a\n\\= specialized language (or combinators) for the metacomparators\n\\= themselves. This language would quickly resemble a static type\n\\= system, much like our \"cmpd\" utilities already resemble algebraic\n\\= data type definitions. So, this probably isn't worth solving until\n\\= we take a typed approach.\n\\=\n\\= For now, we can start small, merely providing a single\n\\= metacomparator over names (`name-metacompare`), rather than aiming\n\\= for efficiency and general computation. As long as we have that, we\n\\= can use inefficient association lists to track free variables\n\\= (`free-vars-object`).\n\n\\= (def-type istring-nil string)\n\\= An interpolated string s-expression that consists of a string with\n\\= no interpolations.\n\n\\= (TODO: Use this.)\n\\= (def-type istring-cons string-past interpolated istring-rest)\n\\= An interpolated string s-expression that consists of a string, a\n\\= single interpolated value to go after that string, and a remaining\n\\= interpolated string s-expression to go after that.\n\n\\= (def-type foreign val)\n\\= An s-expression that consists of an embedded value of any type, but\n\\= usually a name. The program may not know of a way to encode the\n\\= name as serializable data, but it can still be passed to\n\\= `(compile ...)`.\n\n\\= (def-type stx stx-details s-expr)\n\\= An s-expression tagged with source location information.\n\n\\= (defn macro-stx-details mode unique-ns definition-ns stx ...)\n\\= Constructs a syntax details object that refers to a macro's input,\n\\= so that the macro's output can be associated with it. The `stx`\n\\= must be a located cons list whose first element is a string or\n\\= foreign name referring to a macro.\n\n\\= (defn ns-get-name name ns ...)\n\\= Obtains a sub-namespace determined by the given namespace, using\n\\= the given name as a \"folder name.\" Usually, distinct \"folder names\"\n\\= will yield distinct sub-namespaces, but sometimes the interpreter\n\\= may be configured so that this isn't the case.\n\n\\= (defn ns-get-string string ns ...)\n\\= Obtains a sub-namespace determined by the first namespace, using\n\\= the given string as a \"folder name.\" Usually, distinct \"folder\n\\= names\" will yield distinct sub-namespaces, but sometimes the\n\\= interpreter may be configured so that this isn't the case.\n\n\\= (defn ns-shadow-name name sub-ns ns ...)\n\\= Creates a new namespace that behaves like the second namespace in\n\\= almost every way, except when the given name is requested as a\n\\= \"folder name\", in which case the first namespace is returned\n\\= instead.\n\n\\= (defn ns-shadow-string string sub-ns ns ...)\n\\= Creates a new namespace that behaves like the second namespace in\n\\= almost every way, except when the given string is requested as a\n\\= \"folder name\", in which case the first namespace is returned\n\\= instead.\n\n\\= The `ns-shadow-name` and `ns-shadow-string` functions can be used\n\\= to establish local macros. A namespace created this way even works\n\\= the same way as the old one when it's used in a `procure-...`\n\\= primitive. This way, we can imagine that the namespace's own\n\\= identity is stored under an entry somewhere in the namespace, just\n\\= using a key that we don't have the ability to construct.\n\n\\= (defn procure-name mode ns ...)\n\\= Uses the given namespace to obtain a first-class name value.

(The meaning of \"already\" may depend on\n\\= how the current modality works. For modalities that are temporal in\n\\= the concrete sense of a wall clock, it has its usual meaning.)\n\n\n\n\\= ===== Reimplementation of the desugarer ===========================\n\n\\= Raw Staccato syntax has two places where the values involved are\n\\= not necessarily serializable:\n\\=\n\\= The `(stc-def-foreign ...)` syntax allows the definition to be an\n\\= arbitrary first-class value, so that metacircular interpreters can\n\\= encapsulate their implementation details.\n\\=\n\\= The `(stc-foreign ...)` syntax allows an arbitrary first-class\n\\= value, such as a string, to survive until run time. Most code\n\\= serializers will not support most values.\n\\=\n\\= The `(stc-proj-pattern-omitted ...)` syntax must contain a\n\\= namespace. When the omitted projection names are inferred, they\n\\= will be taken from \"<ns>/<projection name>/name\", where \"<ns>\" is\n\\= that namespace.\n\n\\= TODO: Put the commented-out types in a

Since a macro will necessarily need\n\\= to *read* existing definitions in order for its implementation code\n\\= to do anything at all, we're allowing other blocking reads by way\n\\= of `procure-defined`. For referential transparency, the\n\\= corresponding `procure-put-defined` writes are performed in a\n\\= commutative monad. If two or more conflicting writes are performed,\n\\= all definitions that depended on reading those writes will be\n\\= retroactively updated. Usually, conflicting definitions are an\n\\= error. However, at a REPL, definitions from a newer command may\n\\= take the place of definitions from an older command without error.\n\\= Errors or updates may cascade through several layers of other\n\\= definitions that depended on them.\n\\=\n\\= Common definitions are stored like so, where slashes represent\n\\= `ns-get-string` except where marked as `ns-get-name`:\n\\=\n\\=   <definition-ns>/constructor-names/<constructor name string>/name\n\\=     = No defined value, but the proper identity to use for the\n\\=       constructor in generated code.\n\\=\n\\=   <definition-ns>/constructors/<ns-get-name: constructor identity>/\n\\=     tag\n\\=     = No defined value, but the identity to use for the constructor\n\\=       in raw Staccato code.\n\\=   <definition-ns>/constructors/<ns-get-name: constructor identity>/\n\\=     projection-list\n\\=     = An ordered list of projection name strings. Projections\n\\=       should only be treated as an ordered list in manually\n\\=       keyboarded code and in macros catering to manually keyboarded\n\\=       code.\n\\=   <definition-ns>/constructors/<ns-get-name: constructor identity>/\n\\=     projection-names/<projection name string>/name\n\\=     = No defined value, but the proper identity to use for the\n\\=       projection in everything except manually keyboarded code.\n\\=\n\\=   <definition-ns>/macro-names/<macro name string>/name\n\\=     = No defined value, but the proper identity to use for the\n\\=       macro in everything except manually keyboarded code.\n\\=\n\\=   <definition-ns>/macros/<ns-get-name: macro identity>/function\n\\=     = A value that can be invoked with the arguments of a macro\n\\=       call.\n\\=\n\\=   <definition-ns>/functions/<ns-get-name: `make-tuple-tag` result>/\n\\=     staccato\n\\=     = An s-expression that can be compiled as a raw, sugarless\n\\=       Staccato function definition.\n\\=\n\\= The usual definition forms generate several definitions all at\n\\= once:\n\\=\n\\=   (def-type ...)\n\\=     * The constructor name information desired.\n\\=     * A macro so that the construction is easy to do.\n\\=     * The name information for that macro.\n\\=     * Constructor name information for a callable value which\n\\=       implements that macro.\n\\=     * A function implementation for that callable value.\n\\=\n\\=   (defn ...)\n\\=     * The function implementation desired.\n\\=     * Constructor name information for a first-class representation\n\\=       of the function.\n\\=     * A macro so that the function is easy to call. (Fortunately,\n\\=       every (defn ...) macro can reuse the same callable value\n\\=       constructor and function implementation.)\n\\=     * The name information for that macro.\n\\=\n\\= A macro's `mode` parameter is the current modality. A modality must\n\\= be passed to certain effectful primitives as a way to give the\n\\= effects something to be deterministic by. (The terms \"mode\" and\n\\= \"modality\" might be idiosyncrasies of this codebase. A more\n\\= standard term is \"world-passing style.\")\n\\=\n\\= A macro's `unique-ns` parameter is a namespace. It's useful in the\n\\= way that gensyms are typically useful in other macro-capable\n\\= languages, but the uniqueness is achieved by playing along: If the\n\\= macro compiles more than one subexpression, each subexpression\n\\= should be given a `unique-ns` derived in different ways from this\n\\= one.\n\\=\n\\= A macro's `definition-ns` parameter is a namespace. If the macro\n\\= needs to install any definitions or look up any definitions, this\n\\= is the namespace for that purpose. It should usually be passed\n\\= as-is to any compiled subexpressions, except when defining a macro\n\\= that's local to a certain subexpression.\n\\=\n\\= A macro's `my-stx-details` parameter is a collection of source\n\\= location information. There's no direct way to deconstruct this\n\\= value, but it conveys information about this macro invocation, so\n\\= the macro can use it to receive attribution for any `stx` values it\n\\= creates.\n\\=\n\\= (TODO: Figure out what the format of source location information\n\\= actually is. For now, this is sort of just an unspecified area, but\n\\= at least a language implementation can use this to hold filenames\n\\= and line numbers in practice. An implementation should be able to\n\\= treat this as a completely empty data structure; it's not needed\n\\= for any variable scoping purposes.)\n\\=\n\\= A macro's `args` parameter is a list of `(stx stx-details s-expr)`\n\\= values.
